# GP3 EBS volume types are significantly cheaper than GP2 types, especially when the number of existing volumes is vast and the team continues to create them.
# Automate the change from gp2 to gp3. At a specified recurring time (per cronjob), every Monday at 2PM for example, the created lambda function is invoked by the specified cloudwatch event (newly created gp2 volume types). For a specified duration ("timeout" in lambda function) the lambda function will use the python code provided to change all gp2 types to gp3. In this example it is allotted 30 minutes, after which this run will cease, the lambda function with printout the desired results, and will only begin anew upon the next recurring time.
